			I'm the creator of Card Conjurer. I started playing Magic with an M14 deckbuilder's toolkit. I played 60-card casual games with several close friends, and when Khans of Tarkir was released we attended our first prerelease. As the years passed I got more and more into Magic and ultimately discovered Commander, which is the format I currently play.

			During middle school I did some light programming with Processing and Lego's NXT/EV3, and halfway through high school I taught myself Javascript, HTML, and CSS (the languages that compose websites). Then, in the summer of 2018, I combined my love for Magic and curiosity for programming by creating Card Conjurer.

			I initially wanted to make some Commander Achievement cards that looked like real Magic cards, so I decided to make a small web-based application to fill blank magic card images with text and mana symbols. It worked surprisingly well, and I soon began to expand on the original idea by adding more customization and more frames. By the end of summer break I decided to purchase the domain CardConjurer.com so I could share my program with the world. Since then I've remade the entire website from the ground-up four times, and am very pleased with its current state. While I don't plan on any major revisions, I will continue adding new frames and features.

			I graduated high school in 2020, and because I had such a great time learning to code and discovering how much it could accomplish I decided to pursue programming. As of Fall of 2020, I've been attending CalPoly SLO majoring in Software Engineering.
